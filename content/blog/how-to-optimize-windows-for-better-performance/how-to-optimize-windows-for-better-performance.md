Some practical steps to speed up your Windows system. No fluff, just actionable tips.

## 1. Disable Unnecessary Startup Programs

Programs that launch at startup can slow down your boot time and hog resources.

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open Task Manager.
- Go to the **Startup** tab.
- Look at the **Startup impact** column. Right-click and select **Disable** for anything labeled "High" or "Medium" that you don’t need immediately (e.g., Spotify, Discord).
- Don’t disable system-critical stuff like antivirus or drivers.

## 2. Uninstall Bloatware

Pre-installed apps or unused software waste space and resources.

- Go to **Settings** `Win + I` > **Apps** > **Apps & features**.
- Sort by size or install date. Uninstall anything you don’t need.
- Be cautious, don’t remove system apps unless you know what you’re doing.

## 3. Manage Background Apps

Apps running in the background can drain resources even when you’re not using them.

- Go to **Settings** `Win + I` > **Apps** > **Apps & features**.
- Search for apps you don’t need running (e.g., Xbox Game Bar, Cortana).
- Click the app, select **Advanced options** (if available), and turn off permissions to run in the background.
- Alternatively, go to **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Background apps** and toggle off apps you don’t need.

## 4. Adjust Power Settings for Performance

Windows might throttle performance to save power, especially on laptops.

- Go to **Control Panel** > **Hardware and Sound** > **Power Options**.
- Select the **High performance** plan. If it’s not there, click **Create a power plan** and set it up.
- For fine-tuning, click **Change plan settings** > **Change advanced power settings**. Set "Processor power management" > "Minimum processor state" to 100% for max performance.

## 5. Free Up Disk Space

A full drive slows down Windows because it needs space for virtual memory and temp files.

- Press ``Win + R``, type **cleanmgr**, and hit Enter.
- Choose your main drive (usually C:), then click **OK**.
- Check boxes like "Temporary files, " "Recycle Bin, " and "Thumbnails." Click **OK** to delete.
- For deeper cleaning, click **Clean up system files** and select stuff like "Windows Update Cleanup" if available.

## 6. Update Windows and Drivers

Outdated software can cause performance issues or bugs.

- Go to **Settings** `Win + I `> **Windows Update** > **Check for updates**. Install any pending updates.
- For drivers, right-click the Start button, select **Device Manager**, and look for yellow triangles (issues). Right-click devices and choose **Update driver** > **Search automatically**.
- Optionally, use a tool like NVIDIA GeForce Experience or AMD Radeon Software for GPU drivers if you have a dedicated graphics card.

## 7. Disable Indexing for Non-Essential Drives

Search indexing speeds up file searches but can slow down your system, especially on older HDDs.

- Press `Win + R`, type control, and hit Enter to open Control Panel.
- Go to **Indexing Options**.
- Click **Modify**, then uncheck drives or folders you don’t need indexed (e.g., game folders, external drives).
- Click **OK**, then **Close**.

## 8. Check for Malware

Malware can drag performance down by running hidden processes.

- Open **Windows Security** (search for it in the Start menu).
- Go to **Virus & threat protection** > **Quick scan**. Run it.
- For deeper checks, click **Scan options** and select **Full scan**.
- If you suspect something nastier, download Malwarebytes (free version) and run a scan.

## 9. Monitor Resource Usage

Identify what’s slowing you down with built-in tools.

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open Task Manager.
- Check the **Processes** tab for high CPU, memory, or disk usage. Sort by each column to spot culprits.
- If something like "Service Host" is spiking, Google the specific process name to troubleshoot.
- Switch to the **Performance** tab to see overall usage trends and memory pressure.

## 10. Turn Off Visual Effects

Windows animations and effects look nice but eat CPU and memory.

- Press `Win + R`, type sysdm.cpl, and hit Enter.
- Go to the **Advanced** tab, then click **Settings** under Performance.
- Choose **Adjust for best performance** to disable all effects, or pick **Custom** and uncheck stuff like "Animate windows" and "Show shadows under windows."
- Click **Apply**, then **OK**.

## Quick Notes

- Restart your PC after making these changes to ensure they take effect.
- If you’re still lagging, check your hardware, old CPUs, low RAM (less than 8GB), or failing drives might be the real issue.
- For gamers, also update GPU drivers and tweak in-game settings like resolution or shadows.

That’s it. Test these steps and you should notice a difference. If not, let me know what’s still slow, and I’ll dig deeper.
