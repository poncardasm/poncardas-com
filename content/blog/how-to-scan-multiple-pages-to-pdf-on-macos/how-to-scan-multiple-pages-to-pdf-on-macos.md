## Step 3: Adjust scanning settings

1. The right-hand panel allows you to adjust your scan settings
2. When you’re done adjusting your settings, click the Scan button

**Kind:** Choose between color or black and white.

**Resolution:** Determines scan quality—higher values means better quality but also increase file size.

**Size:** Leave as auto or select a standard paper size, e.g., A4.

**Orientation:** Automatically detects document orientation, but manual adjustments are possible.

**Scan To:** Choose where your scan will be saved.

**Name:** Specify the filename of your scanned document.

**Format:** Choose the desired image format, such as .jpeg, .png, or .pdf for documents.

**Combine into single document:** Make sure to check it—it’s the key step to get all your scans into one file.
