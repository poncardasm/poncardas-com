I get asked for help when my friends fall victim to phishing scams, clicking links that end up getting their accounts taken over by scammers. I decided to write this post so I don't have to keep repeating instructions on how to secure and protect their Facebook accounts.

## 1. Use Strong and Unique Password

Your password is your first line of defense. If it's weak or you're using the same password across multiple sites, you're making it easy for attackers to break in.

- **Make it long and complex**: Aim for at least 12 characters, mixing letters (upper and lowercase), numbers, and symbols.
- **Don't reuse passwords**: If a scammer gets your password from another site (like a data breach), they'll try it on Facebook too.
- **Use a password manager**: Tools like 1Password can generate and store strong passwords for you.

## 2. Turn On Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security. Even if someone gets your password, they can't log in without a second code. Here's how to set it up:

1. Go to **Meta Accounts Center** `https://accountscenter.facebook.com/`
2. Click **Password and Security**
3. Click **Two-factor authentication**
4. Download an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or iOS Passwords app), or security key, and follow the prompts.

**Why it works**: Scammers might trick you into giving up your password, but they won't have access to your phone or authenticator app.

## 3. Avoid Common Scams

Some red flags to watch out for:

- **"Friend in need" scams**: A "friend" messages you asking for money because they're in an "emergency situation." Call them directly to verify, it's often a hacked account.
- **Too-good-to-be-true offers**: Ads or posts promising free gift cards or prizes if you "click links" are usually bait.
- **Quizzes and games**: Those "What's your spirit animal?" quizzes might be harvesting your personal info.

**Stay safe**: Don't share personal details (like your phone number or address) in messages or posts, and report suspicious activity to Facebook.

## 4. Lock Down Your Privacy Settings

Scammers gather info from public profiles to craft convincing scams. Take a minute to tighten things up:

1. Go to **Settings & Privacy** > **Privacy Checkup**.
2. Adjust **Who can see your posts?** from "Public" to "Friends".
3. Limit **Who can find you?** turn off search by phone number or email.
4. Review your **Profile Information** hide your birthday, hometown, or anything scammers could use.

**Bonus**: Check **Apps and Websites** under Settings to revoke access from any third-party apps you don't use anymore.

## 5. Know What to Do If Something Goes Wrong

If you think your account has been hacked or you've fallen for a scam:

- **Change your password immediately** from a trusted device.
- **Log out of all devices**: Go to **Security and Login** > **Where You're Logged In** and click "Log Out of All Sessions." `https://accountscenter.facebook.com/password_and_security/login_activity/`
- **Report it**: Use Facebook's "Hacked Account" tool at `facebook.com/hacked`.

Be safe out there! ✌️
